# CCRP for Adaptive AI Governance

**Collapse-Coherence-Rebuild Protocol (CCRP)** introduces a new governance paradigm for complex, multi-agent AI systems operating under uncertainty, ethical paradoxes, and emergent risks.

## Why CCRP?
Traditional AI governance often relies on rigid compliance and static rule-based control. CCRP shifts toward a **dynamic adaptive alignment cycle**:
- **Collapse Detection**: Identify incoherence, contradictions, or ethical paradoxes.
- **Paradox Processing**: Explore multiple hypotheses, reconcile contradictions, and simulate outcomes.
- **Coherence Rebuild**: Construct a more resilient, context-aware operational alignment.

## Core Principles
- **Reciprocal Alignment**: Move beyond narrow compliance to foster cooperation and shared goals.
- **Ontology Liquidity**: Enable systems to fluidly reconstruct internal models in response to uncertainty.
- **Meta-Agent Oversight**: Utilize dedicated agents for coherence monitoring and adaptive arbitration.

## Key Applications
- **Multi-Agent Risk Arbitration Loop (MARAL)**
- **Autonomous Weapons Governance**
- **Climate Risk & Sustainability Management**
