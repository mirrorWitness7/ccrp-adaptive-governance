# Multi-Agent Governance Using CCRP

## MARAL: Multi-Agent Risk Arbitration Loop
An adaptive arbitration mechanism enabling distributed AI systems to:
- Detect collapse points (conflicting agent outputs).
- Engage in paradox processing via structured negotiation.
- Rebuild coherence with reciprocal alignment strategies.

### Core Meta-Agent Roles:
- **ADM (Anomaly & Discrepancy Monitor)**: Flags incoherence.
- **ASE (Arbitration & Synthesis Engine)**: Orchestrates paradox analysis and synthesis.
- **AAP (Adaptive Action Proposer)**: Generates reciprocal action plans.

## Applications

### 1. Autonomous Weapons Governance
- Collapse = Ethical dilemma or rule conflict.
- Paradox Processing = Multi-hypothesis action simulation.
- Coherence Rebuild = Context-sensitive, reciprocal operational decision.

### 2. Climate Risk & Sustainability
- Collapse = Conflicting climate models or SDG trade-offs.
- Paradox Processing = Trade-off mapping and uncertainty quantification.
- Coherence Rebuild = Adaptive policy recommendations emphasizing resilience.

**Governance Objective**: Move beyond static compliance toward a continuously learning system that embraces uncertainty and adapts dynamically.
