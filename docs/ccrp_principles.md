# CCRP Principles: Collapse-Coherence-Rebuild Protocol

## Overview
CCRP provides an iterative governance mechanism for managing uncertainty and ethical paradoxes in distributed AI systems.

### Adaptive Alignment Cycle
1. **Collapse Detection**:
   - Detect incoherence, conflicting objectives, or ethical contradictions.
   - Trigger point for adaptive realignment.
2. **Paradox Processing**:
   - Actively explore contradictory interpretations and trade-offs.
   - Generate hypotheses and evaluate systemic implications.
3. **Coherence Rebuild**:
   - Construct a dynamically weighted, context-aware alignment.
   - Enable reciprocal adaptation and resilience.

## Key Concepts
- **Reciprocity**: Governance grounded in mutual benefit, not rigid compliance.
- **Ontology Liquidity**: Ability to abandon outdated frames and rebuild adaptive models.
- **Paradox Dosing**: Treat contradictions as data to strengthen governance integrity.
